# neural-network-challenge-1

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a student loan borrower will repay their loan based on historical data. The model aims to help a company specializing in student loan refinancing by providing more accurate interest rates for borrowers. By predicting the likelihood of repayment, the company can tailor loan terms to each borrower’s risk profile, offering better rates and reducing potential losses.

## Objectives 
Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques (including neural networks) to estimate the likelihood of a borrower repaying their loan.

Preprocess the provided CSV dataset to extract relevant features and handle missing or inconsistent data.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for performance, including classification algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Optimize the model’s performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

Use the final model to make predictions for new loan applicants, providing the company with actionable insights for better interest rate offers.
