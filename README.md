This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a student loan borrower will repay their loan based on historical data. The model aims to help a company specializing in student loan refinancing by providing more accurate interest rates for borrowers. By predicting the likelihood of repayment, the company can tailor loan terms to each borrowerâ€™s risk profile, offering better rates and reducing potential losses.
